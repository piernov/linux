* sun8i THS

Required properties:
- compatible : "allwinner,sun8i-h3-ths"
- reg : Address range of the thermal registers and location of the calibration
        value
- resets : Must contain an entry for each entry in reset-names.
           see ../reset/reset.txt for details
- reset-names : Must include the name "ahb"
- clocks : Must contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.
- clock-names : Must contain "ahb" for the bus gate and "ths" for the THS
  clock

Optional properties:
- nvmem-cells : Must contain an entry for each entry in nvmem-cell-names
- nvmem-cell-names : Must contain "calibration" for the cell containing the
  temperature calibration cell, if available

Example:
ths: ths@01c25000 {
	#thermal-sensor-cells = <0>;
	compatible = "allwinner,sun8i-h3-ths";
	reg = <0x01c25000 0x400>;
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 63 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	resets = <&bus_rst 136>;
	reset-names = "ahb";
	clocks = <&bus_gates 72>, <&ths_clk>;
	clock-names = "ahb", "ths";
	nvmem-cells = <&ths_calibration>;
	nvmem-cell-names = "calibration";
};
