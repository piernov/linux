* Allwinner H3 E(thernet) PHY

The Allwinner H3 integrates an MII ethernet PHY. As with external PHYs,
before it can be configured over the MDIO bus and used, certain hardware
features must be configured, such as the PHY address and LED polarity.
The PHY must also be powered on and brought out of reset.

This is accomplished with regulators and pull-up/downs for external PHYs.
For this internal PHY, a hardware register is programmed.

The same hardware register also contains clock and interface controls
for the MAC. This is also present in earlier SoCs, and is covered by
"allwinner,sun7i-a20-gmac-clk". The controls in the H3 are slightly
different due to the inclusion of what appears to be an RMII-MII
bridge.

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "allwinner,sun8i-h3-ephy"
- reg: address and length of the register set for the device
- clocks: A phandle to the reference clock for this device
- resets: A phandle to the reset control for this device

Ethernet PHY related properties:
- allwinner,ephy-addr: the MDIO bus address the PHY should respond to.
		       If this is not set, the external PHY is used, and
		       everything else in this section is ignored.
- allwinner,leds-active-low: LEDs are active low. Without this, LEDs are
			     active high.

Ethernet MAC clock related properties:
- #clock-cells: should be 0
- clock-output-names: "mac_tx"

Example:

ethernet-phy@01c00030 {
	compatible = "allwinner,sun8i-h3-ephy";
	reg = <0x01c00030 0x4>;
	clocks = <&bus_gates 128>;
	resets = <&ahb_rst 66>;
	allwinner,ephy-addr = <0x1>;
	#clock-cells = <0>;
	clock-output-names = "mac_tx";
};
